Hi! I’m **Angela Gu**, a Data Science student at **New York University** (Class of 2026), passionate about **workflow automation**, **data engineering**, and **backend development**.

This past summer, I interned at **Healthfirst** as a Data Engineering Intern, where I automated legacy ETL workflows using Python, REST APIs, and AWS Glue — reducing manual effort by 30%. I also built a Streamlit-based UI for validation, which cut QA time by 40%.

Previously, I worked at **HireBeat** (AI startup) and **iQiyi** (China's leading streaming platform), focusing on AI-driven automation and BI analytics.

Outside of tech, I enjoy fitness, video editing, and exploring Chinese cuisine.
